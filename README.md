## NAFTA Reactor


NAFTA Reactor is a web application for creating and viewing posts related to the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement).
The app is a collaboration between the Oregon Fair Trade Campaign and Web Developer Alex Widner. The main purpose of the site is to provide clear information about who likes the new agreement, who doesn't like it, and where members of congress stand on it.

The live app can be found [here](http://naftareactor.com/)
